# Attribute `srcset`

_#html_ _#rwd_

```html
<img
     alt="Venice side street"
  srcset="venice-side-street-1.0.jpg,
          venice-side-street-1.5.jpg 1.5x,
          venice-side-street-2.0.jpg 2x,
          venice-side-street-3.0.jpg 3x"
     src="venice-side-street-1.0.jpg" <!-- fallback -->
/>
```

This will load the picture depending on the [device pixel ratio](../js/device-pixel-ratio.md).
Fractional ratios will result in loading the next higher image (2.25 ratio â†’ 3x image).
And it reacts to zooming while the page is being viewed and will load the appropriate image asynchronously.
