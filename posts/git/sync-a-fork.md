# Sync a fork

_#git_

Believe it or not:
Some of my first contributions at GitHub have been downstream pull requests (<q>merge upstream</q>).
This increments the contributions counter while introducing noise.
Don't do it.

Instead follow GitHub's advice:

1. [Configure a remote that points to the upstream repository](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
2. [Merge upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) (fast-forward is okay)
3. [Push your changes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote)
