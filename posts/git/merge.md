# Merge

_#unix_ _#bash_ _#git_

Sometimes the easiest way to merge is using a terminal:

`git merge feature -m "Merge feature into master"`

This requires the current branch to be _master_ as the merge is always going into the current branch.
The above creates a new commit for the current branch, in this case _master_.
