## About the idea

I took this idea from [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) (who himself had taken it from [others](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)) and first heard about it on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902).
I didn't want to constrain myself to write once daily, so I get to add things irregularly here.
