> Stuff I learned

This is a collection of things I learned, primarily to keep for reference and easy look-up, but also as a reminder of how much I forget and the interesting stuff I once have known.
I put them here in the hope that they may be useful for others as well.

Feel free to contribute!

## About the idea

I took this idea from [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) (who himself had taken it from [others](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)) and first heard about it on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902).
I didn't want to constrain myself to write once daily, so I get to add things irregularly here.
